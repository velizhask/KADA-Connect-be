## Testing
### Automated Testing (Recommended)
A comprehensive Postman collection with 41 API endpoints is available:
- **Complete Test Suite**: All endpoints with validation and error testing
- **Multi-Environment**: Development and staging configurations
- **Usage Guide**: See `docs/Postman-Collection-Usage-Guide.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Base64 Caching Issues
**Issue**: Slow initial response times for image data
**Solution**:
- Check cache statistics using the `X-Cache-Stats` response header
- Verify cache is warming up after server restart
- Monitor memory usage to ensure cache isn't being evicted

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check cache performance
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/students | grep X-Cache-Stats
```

#### Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: Unable to connect to Supabase
**Solution**:
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env`
- Check network connectivity to supabase.co
- Ensure service role key has sufficient permissions
- Validate table schemas exist in your Supabase project

#### Performance Issues
**Issue**: Slow API response times
**Solution**:
- Check cache hit rates in response headers
- Monitor memory usage for cache efficiency
- Review database query performance in Supabase dashboard
- Ensure compression middleware is working (check `Content-Encoding: gzip`)

#### CORS Issues
**Issue**: Frontend cannot access API
**Solution**:
- Verify `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your frontend domain
- Check that preflight OPTIONS requests are handled properly
- Ensure proper SSL/HTTPS configuration in production

### Debugging Tools

#### Response Headers for Debugging
Monitor these headers for performance insights:
- `X-Cache-Stats`: Cache hit rates and memory usage
- `X-RateLimit-*`: Rate limiting information
- `ETag`: Cache validation identifier
- `Content-Encoding`: Compression status

#### Logging
The application provides structured logging without emojis:
- Cache operations are logged with `[CACHE HIT]` and `[CACHE MISS]` prefixes
- Database operations include success/error status
- Performance metrics include timing information

#### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Monitor response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3001/api/students
```

Where `curl-format.txt` contains:
```
     time_namelookup:  %{time_namelookup}\n
        time_connect:  %{time_connect}\n
     time_appconnect:  %{time_appconnect}\n
    time_pretransfer:  %{time_pretransfer}\n
       time_redirect:  %{time_redirect}\n
  time_starttransfer:  %{time_starttransfer}\n
                     ----------\n
          time_total:  %{time_total}\n
```

### Performance Optimization Examples

#### Cache Warming
After server restart, warm up caches for optimal performance:
```bash
# Warm student and company caches
curl http://localhost:3001/api/students >/dev/null
curl http://localhost:3001/api/companies >/dev/null
curl http://localhost:3001/api/lookup/industries >/dev/null
curl http://localhost:3001/api/lookup/tech-roles >/dev/null
```

#### Batch Operations
Use pagination parameters for efficient data retrieval:
```bash
# Get first page with optimal cache usage
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/students?page=1&limit=20"

# Use specific filters for better cache hits
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/companies?industry=Technology&page=1"
```

#### Conditional Requests
Leverage ETags for bandwidth efficiency:
```bash
# First request gets ETag
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/students/123

# Subsequent requests use If-None-Match
curl -H "If-None-Match: W/\"abc123\"" http://localhost:3001/api/students/123
```
